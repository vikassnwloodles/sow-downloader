# AI Audit/Readiness Assessment Statement of Work

This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the integration of AI modules to conduct a comprehensive audit aligned with your organizationâ€™s strategic, operational, and ethical goals. The assessment will evaluate AI readiness across leadership, data infrastructure, use cases, and governance, leveraging these modules to streamline processes and ensure compliance.

## 1. Objectives

- **Strategic Alignment**: Map AI goals (increase efficiency, enhance customer experience, drive innovation) to platform capabilities.
- **Data Readiness**: Assess data quality, infrastructure, and governance using AI-driven automation.
- **Ethical Compliance**: Implement transparency and risk mitigation frameworks.
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Define timelines, KPIs, and vendor partnerships for scalable AI adoption.

## 6. Timeline Variability Notice

**Please Note**: The proposed timeline is based on the current project scope and the assumption of resource availability. However, the timeline may vary due to factors such as:

- Complexity of tasks
- Availability of team members and expertise
- Stakeholder feedback and required adjustments
- Integration challenges with existing systems
- Regulatory compliance requirements

We recommend regular reviews and updates to the timeline as the project progresses to ensure alignment with the overall project goals.

## 7. Budget & Compliance

- **Cost Estimate**: Budget will be determined based on platform licenses, configuration, and training needs.
- **Regulatory Alignment**: AI modules will ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

**Next Steps**: Finalize platform access, schedule kickoff, and designate internal champions for each tool.
